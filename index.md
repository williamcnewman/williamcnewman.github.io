# William C. Newman1
I am a fourth year PhD student in mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is Hsian-Hua Tseng. 
## Research Interests
Most of my interests lie in algebraic geometry. My favorite sub-area within algebraic geometry is enumerative geometry, which then leads me to studying intersection theory, moduli spaces, and algebraic stacks. Currently, my thesis projects involve studying the Chow rings of some moduli spaces. 

Additionally, I am interested in arithmetic geometry. I am finishing up some papers stemming from work I did at an REU when I was an undergrad. This work involves studying arithmetic properties of self-maps of projective space. 

I am also interested more braodly in number theory and algebra. 
## Mentoring
I help run OSU Cycle, which is a mentoring program designed to pair mathematics graduate students with undergraduate students to do research. 
## CV
Here is my CV.
