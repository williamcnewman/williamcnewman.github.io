# William C. Newman 
I am a sixth year PhD student in mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is [Hsian-Hua Tseng](https://people.math.osu.edu/tseng.109/). 
## Research Interests
I work in algebraic geometry. My thesis work deals with intersection theory on moduli spaces. My other work, past and present, is on various topics withing algebraic geometry, most of which deal with aspects of the Chow groups/cohomology of varieties. I am also interested in combinatorics and number theory.
## Preprints
[Tame nodal stacky curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20629) with Martin Bishop

[The first higher Chow groups of \mathcal{M}_{1,n} for n\leq 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20264) 
## Mentoring
I helped create and currently sit on the board of [OSU Cycle](https://math.osu.edu/undergrad/osu-cycle), which is a mentoring program designed to pair mathematics graduate students with undergraduate students to do research. 
## CV
Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).
## Minicourse
In May 2025, I ran a minicourse on Voevodsky's mixed motives at OSU titled "Motives in May" with [Jake Huryn](https://jakehuryn.github.io/). The website can be found [here](https://jakehuryn.github.io/motives-in-may/).
