# William C. Newman
I am a fifth year PhD student in mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is [Hsian-Hua Tseng](https://people.math.osu.edu/tseng.109/). 
## Research Interests
Most of my interests lie in algebraic geometry. My favorite sub-area within algebraic geometry is enumerative geometry, which then leads me to studying intersection theory, moduli spaces, and algebraic stacks. I am also interested in combinatorics and number theory.  
## Preprints
[Tame nodal stacky curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20629) with Martin Bishop

[The first higher Chow groups of \mathcal{M}_{1,n} for n\leq 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20264) 
## Minicourse
In May 2025, I ran a minicourse on Voevodsky's mixed motives at OSU titled "Motives in May" with [Jake Huryn](https://jakehuryn.github.io/). The website can be found [here](https://jakehuryn.github.io/motives-in-may/).
## Mentoring
I helped create and currently sit on the board of [OSU Cycle](https://math.osu.edu/undergrad/osu-cycle), which is a mentoring program designed to pair mathematics graduate students with undergraduate students to do research. 
## CV
Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).
