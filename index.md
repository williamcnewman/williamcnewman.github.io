# William C. Newman
I am a fifth year PhD student in mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is [Hsian-Hua Tseng](https://people.math.osu.edu/tseng.109/). 
## Research Interests
Most of my interests lie in algebraic geometry. My favorite sub-area within algebraic geometry is enumerative geometry, which then leads me to studying intersection theory, moduli spaces, and algebraic stacks. I am also interested in combinatorics and number theory.  
## Paper
My paper on the higher Chow groups of M_{1,n} can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20264).
## Minicourse
In May 2025, I ran a minicourse on Voevodsky's Mixed Motives at OSU titled "Motives in May" with [Jake Huryn](https://jakehuryn.github.io/motives-in-may/). The website can be found [here](https://jakehuryn.github.io/motives-in-may/).
## Mentoring
I help run [OSU Cycle](https://math.osu.edu/undergrad/osu-cycle), which is a mentoring program designed to pair mathematics graduate students with undergraduate students to do research. 
## CV
Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).
